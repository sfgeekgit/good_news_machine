## Recommended Starting Set (8-10 indicators)

For the hackathon MVP, focus on these — they have:
- Clear improvement direction
- Strong emotional resonance  
- Good data coverage & time depth
- Easy-to-understand metrics

1. **Child mortality rate** — the ultimate "things are getting better" metric
2. **Life expectancy** — universal, relatable
3. **Extreme poverty rate** — foundational progress indicator
4. **Literacy rate** — education story
5. **Access to electricity** — infrastructure/modernization
6. **Undernourishment prevalence** — hunger story
7. **Maternal mortality** — healthcare story
8. **Vaccination coverage** — public health triumph
9. **Access to clean water** — basic needs
10. **Share of electricity from renewables** — climate hope

## Data Access Notes

### Direct CSV Downloads
Most OWID charts have a "Download" tab that provides CSV files.
Pattern: `https://github.com/owid/owid-datasets/tree/master/datasets/[dataset-name]`

### GitHub Repository
Main data repo: `https://github.com/owid/owid-datasets`
Contains cleaned, documented datasets ready for analysis.

### API / Bulk Access
OWID doesn't have a formal API, but you can:
1. Use the GitHub raw CSV URLs directly
2. Use their grapher URLs with `?tab=table` to see data
3. Clone the owid-datasets repo for bulk access

### Example CSV URL Pattern
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/owid-datasets/master/datasets/[Dataset Name]/[Dataset Name].csv
```

## Milestone Ideas for "Good News" Detection

Beyond trend detection, flag when countries cross meaningful thresholds:

| Milestone | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| Child mortality below 50 per 1,000 | First time in history for many |
| Child mortality below 10 per 1,000 | "Rich country" level |
| Life expectancy above 70 | Major achievement |
| Life expectancy above 80 | Elite tier |
| Extreme poverty below 10% | Approaching elimination |
| Extreme poverty below 3% | Effectively eliminated |
| Literacy above 90% | Near-universal |
| Electricity access above 90% | Near-universal |
| Undernourishment below 5% | Food security achieved |
| Renewable electricity above 50% | Energy transition tipping point |
